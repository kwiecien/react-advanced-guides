Because React relies on heuristics, if the assumptions behind them are not met, performance will suffer.

1. The algorithm will not try to match subtrees of different component types.
   If you see yourself alternating between two component types with very similar output,
   you may want to make it the same type. In practice, we havenâ€™t found this to be an issue.

2. Keys should be stable, predictable, and unique.
   Unstable keys (like those produced by Math.random()) will cause many component instances and DOM nodes
   to be unnecessarily recreated, which can cause performance degradation and lost state in child components.
