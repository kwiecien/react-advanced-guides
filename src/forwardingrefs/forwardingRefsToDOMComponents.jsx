import React from "react";

function FancyButtonWithoutRef(props) {
    return (
        <button className="FancyButton">
            {props.children}
        </button>
    );
}

const FancyButton = React.forwardRef((props, ref) => (
    <button ref={ref} className="FancyButton">
        {props.children}
    </button>
));

// You can now get a ref directly to the DOM button:
const ref = React.createRef();
<FancyButton ref={ref}>Click me!</FancyButton>;

/**
 * Here is a step-by-step explanation of what happens in the above example:

 We create a React ref by calling React.createRef and assign it to a ref variable.
 We pass our ref down to <FancyButton ref={ref}> by specifying it as a JSX attribute.
 React passes the ref to the (props, ref) => ... function inside forwardRef as a second argument.
 We forward this ref argument down to <button ref={ref}> by specifying it as a JSX attribute.
 When the ref is attached, ref.current will point to the <button> DOM node.
